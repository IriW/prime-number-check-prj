# Prime number checker

This is a simple checking program, which calculates if the number provided is prime or not.

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1. [Wikipedia]  
Function is_prime() checks whether the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
It should return True or False.

e.g.
7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
NOTE: 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself, but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1. """
